There are four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry:

- Gryffindor
- Hufflepuff
- Ravenclaw
- Slytherin
Students of each of these houses have their own character traits. These traits are assessed in integer equivalent from 0 to 100.

All Gryffindors are characterized by nobility, honor, and courage.
Hufflepuff students are hardworking, loyal, and honest.
Ravenclaws are smart, wise, witty, and full of creativity.
All Slytherin students are characterized by cunning, determination, ambition, resourcefulness, and a thirst for power.
Absolutely all Hogwarts students can cast spells with a power of a certain number of points and can transgress to a certain distance. The strength of magic and the distance of transgression are different for each student and are expressed in integer equivalent.

- Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are students of the Gryffindor faculty.
- Draco Malfoy, Graham Montague and Gregory Goyle are students of the Slytherin faculty.
- Zachary Smith, Cedric Diggory and Justin Finch-Fletchley are students of the Hufflepuff faculty.
- Chou Chang, Padma Patil and Marcus Belby are students of the Ravenclaw faculty.

Write a program that implements the hogwarts class and four classes by the names of the departments. In the department classes, describe the properties of each listed above. Students should be implemented as objects. It should be possible to set student qualities through the constructor. Assign each property an arbitrary numeric value from 0 to 100.

Make a method that displays a description of a student. The description should include qualities that are inherent in all students, plus qualities that are inherent in a student because he studies in a specific department.

Implement 4 methods, one for each department, that compare two students of the same department by properties. To compare students, you need to add up the points for each property that is inherent in a student of a given department. The student whose sum of properties is greater is considered the best student. The method should display the result of comparing students in the console.

Implement a method that compares any two Hogwarts students by magic power and apparation distance, and prints to the console the comparative score between the two students.
